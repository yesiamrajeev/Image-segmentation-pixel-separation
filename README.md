# Image-segmentation-pixel-separation
An image segmentation application that separates different objects or regions within an image by performing pixel-level separation. The application provides a user-friendly interface to input an image, apply segmentation algorithms, and visualize the segmented regions.

# Features
Load an input image for segmentation.
Apply various segmentation algorithms, such as thresholding, region growing, or graph cuts.
Display the original image and the segmented regions side by side.
Allow users to adjust segmentation parameters and visualize the results in real-time.
Save the segmented image and the corresponding mask or labels.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries/Frameworks: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
Version Control: Git
# Installation
Set up the Python environment with the required dependencies (OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib).
Launch the application.
# Usage
Run the application.
Load an image using the provided functionality.
Choose the desired segmentation algorithm (e.g., thresholding, region growing, graph cuts).
Adjust the segmentation parameters if applicable.
Visualize the original image and the segmented regions side by side.
Save the segmented image and the corresponding mask or labels for further analysis.
